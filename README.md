# Personal-project

Starting to implement what I have learnt so far this week into a project, to create a pin number verification as well as a variety of viewable videos that the user can watch and interact with

Encountered an issue with the pin entering system however the rest of the project functions as it should 
Videos streaming - check 
Navigation of the UI - check 
Pin button interaction - check 
Pin verification - Fail 
Pin pad - Created but contains bugs
